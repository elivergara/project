#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/mppi3EwoVFc?si=q0S8czQY-w_ydXLF>
#### Description:
The **Digital Recipe Book** is a command-line program developed for the CS50P course. It allows users to create, store, edit, and manage their own recipes. Each user has a personal recipe book accessible through a simple login system.   
While it was designed with cooking recipes in mind, this can apply to any other kind of recipes or instructions!

## CS50P Final Project

**Course:** CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python - Harvard University  
**Author:** Eli Vergara (GitHub: [elivergara](https://github.com/elivergara))  
**Date:** October 30, 2024

### Features
1. **User Login**: Users must register and log in to access their recipe book.

3. - **Logout**: Exit the program.

### Requirements

- **Libraries**: 
  - `csv`, `os`, `textwrap`, `tabulate`, `pyfiglet`
- Install required libraries:

### Next Steps
The next step is to add a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using **Tkinter** to make it more user-friendly.

### Motivation
This project was inspired by my wife's request to organize her recipes digitally. It applies concepts like user management, file handling, and command-line menus from CS50P.
